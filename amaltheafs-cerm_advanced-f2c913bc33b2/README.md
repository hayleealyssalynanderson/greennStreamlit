To bring context as to how the repository is structured:

-main embeds all the major python scripts, necessary to use the CERM (named LCERM here to differentiate with CERM with idiosyncratic risks)

-plus embeds python scripts that present tracks of study for the following (regression of losses with climate coefficients, ...) or that have been used to calibrate this or that climate coefficient

-unused embeds python scripts that are not used anymore, as I have not found use for them after all

-outdated embeds outdated python scripts, only for """historical""" purposes

The scripts in main are all detailed
